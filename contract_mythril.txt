==== Transaction Order Dependence ====
SWC ID: 114
Severity: Medium
Contract: HashForEther
Function name: _sendWinnings()
PC address: 177
Estimated Gas Usage: 1644 - 35925
The value of the call is dependent on balance or storage write
This can lead to race conditions. An attacker may be able to run a transaction after our transaction which can change the value of the call

Any sender can withdraw Ether from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can profitably extract Ether from the contract account. Verify the business logic carefully and make sure that appropriate security controls are in place to prevent unexpected loss of funds.
